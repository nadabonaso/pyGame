# catcher_in_the_sky

## About
My first game created in Python using Pygame :)

For this program I used variables, various data types, if statements, loops and nested structures.

###### How to play:
There is a main character which the user can move around the screen with their arrow keys. There are 3 enemies (alien octopi) and 1 prize (unicorn). The goal is to avoid colliding with the enemies. If they catch the prize, they win the game.
